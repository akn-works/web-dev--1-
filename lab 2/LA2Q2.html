        <P>Tanjiro Kamado is the kind and determined protagonist 
        of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, who becomes a Demon Slayer 
        after a demon attack kills his family and turns his sister 
        Nezuko into a demon. He possesses a strong sense of compassion,
         a heightened sense of smell for tracking demons, and uses a
          unique combat style combining the Water Breathing technique 
          with his family's Hinokami Kagura dance. His singular goal
           is to find a way to turn Nezuko back into a human</P>
