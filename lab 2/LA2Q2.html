        of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, who becomes a Demon Slayer 
        after a demon attack kills his family and turns his sister

         a heightened sense of smell for tracking demons, and uses a
          unique combat style combining the Water Breathing technique 
          with his family's Hinokami Kagura dance. His singular goal
           is to find a way to turn Nezuko back into a human</P>
