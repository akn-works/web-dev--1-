        <P> HELLO  my name is AYUSH KUMAR NAYAK , and I am 17 years old. 
         I am currently a first-year student of Computer Science Engineering with  specialization in Artificial 
         Intelligence and Machine Learning. While I had once aspired to serve my nation by joining the armed forces , my  path led to CSE , 
         where I  now aim to contribute  to my country through 
        technology and innovation. I have a deep passion for studying and researching in this field , as i find 
        the world of computers , which built on logic yet capable of 
        creating such magical outcomes truly fascinating .

        <P> 
            I have a deep lov for movies and art, as they allow me to explore 
            creativity and different perspectives. Watching movies is not only a source of entertainment
            for me but also a way to understand storytelling, emotions , and culture in unique ways . Similarly
             engaging with art helps me express my thoughts and imaginationbeyond words .
